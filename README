Raaga.com Screen-Scraper to Extract Metadata Information for Indic Songs.

The Project is still a Work-In-Progress

SETUP

This is how i'd setup a dev-env for this project

prudhvi$ virtualenv --distribute pyenv
prudhvi$ source pyenv/bin/activiate
(pyenv)prudhvi$ pip install lxml

And you can run tests from within your pyenv, not messing with your system
python libs.
